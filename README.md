Jeff's Static Website Account Manager

The purpose of this is to help me manage a classroom of people trying to make websites (say, 30 of them). I want to be able to provide a URI where students can pick a subdomain, push a button, get some credentials, and start editing html. The ideal is that the students will have a real website. Ideally, they could take those credentials and play with it at home (for some period of time).
